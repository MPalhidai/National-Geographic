Future Suggestions Add:


cover search icon JS that turns into an input form box on select

larger, more bold, any effects on magazine title center page
space below bottom right links
line bottom right links up with the nav bar sandwich with same width letters
slightly more padding between white and yellow links

overlapped magazine article date
article one overlapping carousel
article one wording left aligned with picture and line

article two overlap and switch right and left carousel

app section text should maintain breaks and not resize.
