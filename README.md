# National Geographic

Implementation of concept designed by Andrew Baygulov on Dribbble.com
https://dribbble.com/shots/2074547-National-Geographic-Splash-Page/attachments/372143

Future Suggestions Add:
make the icon and title more bold
less space between header links
cover search icon JS that turns into an input form box on select
hamburger menu should not affect icon and should not apply opacity to list items
larger, more bold, any effects on magazine title center page
space below bottom right links
line bottom right links up with the nav bar sandwich with same width letters
slightly more padding between white and yellow links

overlapped magazine article date
article one overlapping carousel
article one wording left aligned with picture and line

article two overlap and switch right and left carousel

app section text should maintain breaks and not resize.
